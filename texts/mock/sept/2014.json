"content" : "When people expect to see someone again, they are more likely to find that person attractive, regardless of the individual's behavior, than if they do not have expectations of future interaction. The expectation of future interaction motivates people to look for positive qualities in someone so that they will look forward to future interactions rather than dread them, and increases the chances that people will find the individual attractive. Conversely, when people interact with someone whom they do not foresee meeting again, they have little reason to search for positive qualities. In fact, doing so may be depressing, given that they may not have the opportunity to get to know the person better in future interactions. Indeed, people are sometimes motivated to find negative qualities in individuals whom they do not expect to see again."

An animal in a group also has a smaller chance of being the unlucky individual picked out by a predator. In addition, a group of animals fleeing from a predator can create confusion. This makes it harder for a predator to focus on one animal to catch. A school of fish will split in two to avoid a predator and then quickly regroup behind it. A herd of zebras can become a dazzling display of black and white stripes, making it more difficult for a lion to see where one zebra ends and another begins."

It doesn't matter if that person is a marketer, salesperson, designer, programmer, or whatever; their writing skills will pay off. That's because being a good writer is about more than writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Good writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves in someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate. Writing is making a comeback all over our society. Look at how much communication happens through instant messaging and blogging. Writing is today's currency for good ideas. Thus, it is essential to welcome people with good writing skills into your company."

Get rid of your belongings and buy buying the condominium. It is fruitless to look at condominiums when you have spent the past 20-odd years in a large house and then try to move all of your life into the smaller investment. To do so often leads to frustration because what you wind up purchasing is an expensive warehouse for your furniture, and that is usually the wrong investment. If you want to change your lifestyle, you must accept the consequences of that decision. Throwing things out only hurt hurts for a little while. "

Some children follow the suggestion that sandals may not be the best option for a snowy day. For those kids, experience may be the best teacher. For example, when Lydia was eight years old, she insisted on wearing her favorite sandals to school despite  warnings that the sidewalks were covered in snow and slush. Her mom worried that she would arrive at school with cold, wet feet, but Lydia would not change her mind. Of course, her mother was right. While Lydia did have some very uncomfortable toes because they became soaked and frozen on her way to and from school, she learned that sometimes fashion isn't worth the price of serious discomfort"

In Latin America and the Caribbean, women's waged non-agricultural employment increased more than five percentage points between 1990 and 2006. In 2006, the percentage of women's waged non-agricultural employment in East Asia and Pacific countries was twice as high as that of South Asia. In that same year, the percentage of women's waged non-agricultural employment in the Middle East and North Africa was less than that of Sub-Saharan Africa by ten percentage points. Despite the improvement between 1990 and 2006, South Asia showed the smallest increase in the percentage of women in waged non-agricultural employment. Between 1990 and 2006, the increase in the percentage of women's waged non-agricultural employment in Sub-Saharan Africa was larger than that of the Middle East and North Africa"

There was nothing addressed to her. It was her sixteenth birthday today, but there wasn't even a birthday card from her father. \"I didn't get anything from Dad,\" said Kate to her mother. \"I can't believe he forgot my birthday.\" Kate's father was a doctor, and every summer he went to Africa to treat people who were too poor to go to a hospital. \"Well, he didn't forget your birthday, Kate. I was going to give this to you at your birthday party this afternoon,\" said her mother, giving her a small pink box with a purple ribbon, which arrived from Africa the day before. \"Yeah, I knew Dad wouldn't let me down!\" shouted Kate, smiling the sweetest smile."

When you finished shopping, you may have left the spot with a certain hesitation, particularly if someone else was waiting for it. Studies have shown that people take longer to leave a parking spot when another driver is waiting, even though they predict they will not. It's as if the space suddenly becomes more valuable once another person wants it. Strictly speaking, it is no longer valuable to the person leaving it. After all, it seems that our brains are so that once we have been given something, we are hesitant to give it up."

Many species of tree are now endangered, including mahogany and teak, and deforestation, particularly in tropical rainforests, has had a severe impact both on local communities and on native plants and wildlife. Where wood is harvested and then transported halfway across the globe, the associated energy costs are high, causing a negative impact on the environment. What is more, where wood is treated with chemicals to improve fire- and pest-resistance, its healthful properties are compromised."

But its association with humans also carried maize far beyond its origins as a little-known Mexican grass, so that it is now one of the most widely planted crops on earth. From mankind's point of view, meanwhile, the domestication of maize made available an abundant new source of food. But its cultivation (like that of other plants) prompted people to adopt a new lifestyle based on farming. Is man taking advantage of maize for his own purposes, or is maize taking advantage of man? Domestication, it seems, is ."

Pride causes individuals to be out of touch with the reality of who they truly are and of what really brings happiness.

When individuals have a true sense of self-worth, they do not need to compare themselves with others, to tear others apart or feel superior.  , there is an experience of oneness and sharing.

Many people enjoy this form of exercise because it can be done outdoors in fresh air where the scenery can be changed by altering the course of the walk. Alternatively, the exercise may be done indoors, in a climate-controlled environment, on a treadmill. People should start with a short distance on flat ground and gradually increase the distance and intensity. Instruct people to sit on the bench and to start reading their newspapers carefully. While power walking, people should wear shoes with a good arch support to avoid injury and wear clothes appropriate for the climate."

"content" : "To create a unifying theme for the many crowd scenes, he invented a character of a backpacking tourist who would appear in each location. In 1986, Martin Handford, a young British commercial artist who specialized in drawing cartoon scenes for clients, had the idea of publishing his illustrations in book form. His idea was to depict humorous crowd scenes in various locations, including a beach, a train station, and a country fair. In the original British editions of the book, the character's name was Wally. He went on to publish seven more Where's Wally books, create a television show, and license several video games. Although the fad for his character declined in the late 1990s, there is still occasional talk of a Wally movie. Wally is licensed in at least 17 countries, where he looks pretty much the same but often goes by different names"

If you learned about a culture in which a certain type of chair was used only for the purpose of sitting while waiting for a bus, you might think this is odd but would have no difficulty understanding it.  Consider a chair. Before you can have an idea of a chair, you need to understand that there exist in the world certain functional objects. Some of these objects support human activity, in this case, sitting.  The combination of the concepts chair and waiting for bus allows you to create the new complex concept chair used while waiting for bus. But the basic concept of chair is built out of the simpler ideas that we take for granted: object, furniture, sitting."

"content" : "Effective communication is vital to achieving wellness because our daily interactions with others are important factors in our emotional health. People who have developed a high degree of communication skills are more likely to have the potential for deeper bonds in their personal relationships than non-communicators. Perhaps the greatest communication satisfaction comes from our close relationships, which are the main source of our emotional health. Close relationships develop when two people can exchange emotional messages easily and effectively. Whether we develop effective communication skills that promote healthy interactions depends largely on how we learn to communicate. For example, interaction between parents and their children is often important in determining whether a child is shy or unafraid of interaction. Good parents listen to their children and allow them to talk about their fears and unhappiness. Children raised in households that  communication find it easier to talk to others about their disappointments, fears, frustrations, and other emotions later in life. Such individuals find that they ultimately have better emotional health. 41.      ?"

This was a tornado. Looking at the kids around her, Janet yelled as loudly as she could, \"Rick and Matt, get Mr. Grey on that cart and roll him over here! Everyone else, grab the music stands and bring them next to the piano. Hurry!\" When everyone came back, Janet asked five of them to follow. They ran to where the curtain hung along the wall of the stage. Janet grabbed the edge of the curtain and screamed, \"Everyone, grab hold and pull!\" When the curtain fell, they pulled it over the tops of the music stands and the grand piano. Then, she motioned everyone to get under the curtain. The wind noise rose again, but Janet was now safely hidden inside the piano and curtain fort with the rest of the orchestra. Relieved, they thanked one another and felt oneness in their hearts"
