She tried to read a book but it was not fun at all. All she could do was sit, look at her broken leg, and watch the clock. As she was listening to the dull tick-tock of the clock, her phone vibrated. It was a message with an audio file from her dad. As she opened it, a huge smile spread across her face. Her dad had sent a recording of a little wren's song her favorite bird song. Listening to the bright warm sounds lifted her spirits and made her day more pleasant"

They may be too aggressive. Too direct. Maybe even a little mean. Perhaps they are bad at giving feedback because no one ever taught them how. Or perhaps they've had bosses who were bad at giving them feedback. Try to brush aside the stuff that offends or upsets you to really try to hear what they are saying you can do better next time. And if they only tell you things like, \"don't let that happen again,\" then work to figure out what you can do better next time, so that it doesn't actually happen again. Preparing to solve a problem for next time feels better than getting upset about our failure to solve it this time."

"content" : "For a long time, tourism was seen as a huge monster invading the areas of indigenous peoples, introducing them to the evils of the modern world. However, research has shown that this is not the correct way to perceive it. In most places, tourists are welcome and indigenous people see tourism as a path to modernity and economic development. But such development is always a two-edged sword. Tourism can mean progress, but most often also means the loss of traditions and cultural uniqueness. And, of course, there are examples of 'cultural pollution', 'vulgarization' and 'phony-folk-cultures'. The background for such characteristics is often more or less romantic and the normative ideas of a former or prevailing authenticity. Ideally (to some) there should exist ancient cultures for modern consumers to gaze at, or even step into for a while, while travelling or on holiday. This is a cage model that is difficult to defend in a global world where we all, indigenous or not, are part of the same social fabric."

"content" : "While genetic advancements are often reported as environmentally dependent or modest in effect size in academic publications, these are often translated to the public in deterministic language through the media. Sociologists of genetics argue that media portrayals of genetic influences on health have increased considerably over time, becoming part of the public discourse through which individuals understand symptoms, make help-seeking decisions, and form views of people with particular traits or conditions. The media is the primary source of information about genetic advances and their applications, but it does not provide a neutral discourse. Rather, information is selectively included or ignored, and scientific and clinical implications of genetic discoveries are often inaccurate or overstated. This \"genetic optimism\" has influenced public opinion, and research suggests that ordinary people are largely accepting of genetic explanations for health and behavior and tend to overestimate the heritability of common diseases for biological relatives."

This is an important focus especially as more and more information becomes available electronically. However, the traditional strengths of libraries have always been their collections. This is true still today especially in research libraries. Also, collection makeup is the hardest thing to change quickly. For example, if a library has a long tradition of heavily collecting materials published in Mexico, then even if that library stops purchasing all Mexican imprints, its Mexican collection will still be large and impressive for several years to come unless they start withdrawing books. Likewise, if a library has not collected much in a subject, and then decides to start collecting heavily in that area it will take several years for the collection to be large enough and rich enough to be considered an important research tool."

Following World War II, academic discourse on aging typically represented these as the causes of senility. The location of senile mental deterioration was no longer the aging brain but a society that, through involuntary retirement, social isolation, and the loosening of traditional family ties, stripped the elderly of the roles that had sustained meaning in their lives. When elderly people were deprived of these meaningful social roles, when they became increasingly isolated and were cut off from the interests and activities that had earlier occupied them, not surprisingly their mental functioning deteriorated. The elderly did not so much lose their minds as lose their place"

Only when the information is repeated can its possessor turn the fact that he knows something into something socially valuable like social recognition, prestige, and notoriety. As long as he keeps his information to himself, he may feel superior to those who do not know it. But knowing and not telling does not give him that feeling of \"superiority that, so to say, latently contained in the secret, fully actualizing itself only at the moment of disclosure.\" This is the main motive for gossiping about well-known figures and superiors. The gossip producer assumes that some of the \"fame\" of the subject of gossip, as  whose \"friend\" he presents himself, will rub off on him"

"content" : "One misconception that often appears in the writings of physical scientists who are looking at biology from the outside is that the environment appears to them to be a static entity, which cannot contribute new bits of information as evolution progresses. This, however, is by no means the case. Far from being static, the environment is constantly changing and offering new challenges to evolving populations. For higher organisms, the most significant changes in the environment are those produced by the contemporaneous evolution of other organisms. The evolution of a horse's hoof from a five-toed foot has enabled the horse to gallop rapidly over open plains. But such galloping is of no advantage to a horse unless it is being chased by a predator. The horse's efficient mechanism for running would never have evolved except for the fact that meat-eating predators were at the same time evolving more efficient methods of attack. Consequently, laws based upon ecological relationships among different kinds of organisms are optional for understanding evolution and the diversity of life to which it has given rise."

Over time, even the embellishments become standardized. An old man's story that he has told hundreds of times shows little variation, and any variation that does exist becomes part of the story itself, regardless of its origin. People add details to their stories that may or may not have occurred. They are recalling indexes and reconstructing details. If at some point they add a nice detail, not really certain of its validity, telling the story with that same detail a few more times will ensure its permanent place in the story index. In other words, the stories we tell time and again are  to the memory we have of the events that the story relates."

Although richer people spend smaller proportions of their income on food, in total they consume more food and richer food, which contributes to various kinds of disease and debilitation. The changes in diet that usually accompany higher incomes will require relatively greater increases in the production of feed grains, rather than food grains, as foods of animal origin partly . It takes two to six times more grain to produce food value through animals than to get the equivalent value directly from plants. It is thus quite credible to estimate that in order to meet economic and social needs within the next three to five decades, the world should be producing more than twice as much grain and agricultural products as at present, but in ways that these are accessible to the food-insecure"

The Oxford definition focuses on \"what\" post-truth is: the idea that feelings sometimes matter more than facts. But just as important is the next question, which is why this ever occurs. Someone does not argue against an obvious or easily confirmable fact for no reason; he or she does so when it is to his or her advantage. When a person's beliefs are threatened by an \"inconvenient fact,\" sometimes it is preferable to challenge the fact. This can happen at either a conscious or unconscious level (since sometimes the person we are seeking to convince is ourselves), but the point is that this sort of post-truth relationship to facts occurs only when we are seeking to assert something ."

British anthropology emphasizes the social. It assumes that social institutions determine culture and that universal domains of society (such as kinship, economy, politics, and religion) are represented by specific institutions (such as the family, subsistence farming, the British Parliament, and the Church of England) which can be compared cross-culturally. American anthropology emphasizes the cultural. It assumes that culture shapes social institutions by providing the shared beliefs, the core values, the communicative tools, and so on that make social life possible. It does not assume that there are universal social domains, preferring instead to discover domains empirically as aspects of each society's own classificatory schemes in other words, its culture. And it rejects the notion that any social institution can be understood ."

Once we've solved the puzzle of how to ballroom dance, for example, we can do it by habit, and so be mentally freed to focus on a conversation while dancing instead. But try to talk when first learning to dance the tango, and it's a disaster we need our conscious attention to focus on the steps. Tango musicians bring different genres of music together to attract a more diverse audience from varying backgrounds.

No citizen could be a full member of the community so long as she was tied to ancestral traditions with which the community might wish to break the problem of Antigone in Sophocles' tragedy. Sovereignty and citizenship thus require not only borders in space, but also borders in time. Sovereignty and citizenship require freedom from the past at least as much as freedom from contemporary powers. No state could be sovereign if its inhabitants lacked the ability to change a course of action adopted by their forefathers in the past, or even one to which they once committed themselves. But freedom in space (and limits on its territorial extent) is merely one characteristic of sovereignty. Freedom in time (and limits on its temporal extent) is equally important and probably more fundamental."

For example, the chemist assumes that chemical reactions are lawful, and the physicist assumes that the physical world is lawful. The determinist, then, assumes that everything that occurs is a function of a finite number of causes and that, if these causes were known, an event could be predicted with complete accuracy. However, knowing all causes of an event is not necessary; the determinist simply assumes that they exist and that as more causes are known, predictions become more accurate. The assumption that what is being studied can be understood in terms of causal laws is called determinism. Richard Taylor defined determinism as the philosophical doctrine that \"states that for everything that ever happens there are conditions such that, given them, nothing else could happen.\" For example, almost everyone would agree that the weather is a function of a finite number of variables such as sunspots, high-altitude jet streams, and barometric pressure; yet weather forecasts are always probabilistic because many of these variables change constantly, and others are simply unknown"

There is obviously a wide gap between the promises of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and the real world of human-rights violations. In so far as we sympathize with the victims, we may criticize the UN and its member governments for failing to keep their promises.  However, we cannot understand the gap between human-rights ideals and the real world of human-rights violations by sympathy or by legal analysis. Rather, it requires investigation by the various social sciences of the causes of social conflict and political oppression, and of the interaction between national and international politics. The UN introduced the concept of human rights into international law and politics. It is a leading feature of the human-rights field that the governments of the world proclaim human rights but have a highly variable record of implementing them.  We must understand why this is so"

Representational theories of art treat the work of the artist as similar to that of the scientist. Both, so to speak, are involved in describing the external world. But by the nineteenth century, any comparison between the scientist and the artist was bound to make the artist look like a poor relation in terms of making discoveries about the world or holding a mirror up to nature. Here, science clearly had the edge. The notion that art specialized in the expression of the emotions was particularly attractive in this light. It rendered unto science its own the exploration of the objective world while saving something comparably important for art to do to explore the inner world of feeling. If science held the mirror up to nature, art turned a mirror at the self and its experiences."

The speed with which \"radical\" designs by celebrity architects achieve acceptance and popularity demonstrates that formal innovation has itself become an important commodity.

We use instruments to measure bulk properties of the environment, such as salinity and temperature, and we use bottle or net samples to extract knowledge about the organisms living in the ocean. This kind of approach has contributed important knowledge but has also influenced the way we view marine life. It leads us to focus on abundances, production rates, and distribution patterns. Such a perspective is very relevant in the context of the ocean as a resource for fisheries. It is also helpful in developing an understanding of biogeochemical issues such as ocean carbon fluxes. But on its own, this approach is insufficient, even for those purposes. The kind of intuition that we develop about marine life is, of course, influenced by the way we  observe it. Because the ocean is inaccessible to us and most planktonic organisms are microscopic, our intuition is elementary compared, for example, to the intuitive understanding we have about (macroscopic) terrestrial life. Our understanding of the biology of planktonic organisms is still based mainly on examinations of (dead) individuals, field samples, and incubation experiments, and even our sampling may be severely biased toward those organisms that are not destroyed by our harsh sampling methods. Similarly, experimental observations are extended to those organisms that we can collect live and keep and cultivate in the laboratory.  * salinity:  ** flux:  *** terrestrial:"
