Unfortunately, I have just become aware that your company's limit of 53 people for registration has already been reached. However, I would really appreciate it if you could allow my son to register additionally. He is a big fan of the Red Sox, and this trip would make a great surprise gift for his birthday. If there is any way that he is able to join the trip, I would be very grateful. I'm sure it would give him the perfect birthday. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely, Cathy Cameron"

She tried not to think about her terrible performance in class. Watching Amy look so discouraged, Laurie, her best friend, decided she needed some cheering up. So Laurie crossed her eyes and made a stupid face. Amy tried not to look, but Laurie was making another funny face. This time she couldn't help turning back to see what her friend was doing. It was her famous fish face: she was pushing her ears out, crossing her eyes, and opening her mouth wide. Amy laughed hard. She felt that she was lucky to have a friend that could always cheer her up when she was feeling down."

A few mixed-up letters, a couple of crumpled papers, and some help from Daddy later, he handed me his heart on the page. Then, finally, he relaxed enough to fall asleep. Sometimes, saying how you feel just isn't enough. Spoken words are invisible and untouchable. Write it down, however, and you can see it, feel it, hold it, keep it forever. Although we may think it, we can't really give someone our heart. But by writing, we can give someone our heart on a page. A love note is a piece of paper that is a little piece of your heart. Teach your child how to write love notes, and I promise you will have many, many happy returns"

"content" : "One of the most demanding, and at the same time inspiring, aspects of translating for children is the potential for such creativity that arises from what Peter Hollindale has called the 'childness' of children's texts: 'the quality of being a child dynamic, imaginative, experimental, interactive and unstable'. The 'unstable' qualities of childhood that Hollindale cites require a writer or translator to have an understanding of the freshness of language to the child's eye and ear, the child's affective concerns and the linguistic and dramatic play of early childhood. Translating sound, for example, whether in the read-aloud qualities of books for the younger child, in animal noises, children's poetry or in nonsense rhymes, demands imaginative solutions as indeed does working with visual material. Such multi-faceted creativity has, at times, placed children's literature at the forefront of imaginative  experimentation"

"content" : "From an evolutionary perspective, fear has contributed to both fostering and limiting change, and to preserving the species. We are programmed to be afraid. It is a survival need, as is stability, which is another force of nature that can limit the capacity to change. Stable patterns are necessary lest we live in chaos; however, they make it difficult to abandon entrenched behaviors, even those that are no longer useful, constructive, or health creating. And fear can keep you from changing when you don't want to risk a step into unknown territory; for example, some people choose not to leave an unfulfilling job or a failing relationship because they fear the unknown more than the known. On the other hand, fear can also motivate change in order to avoid something you're afraid of, such as dying young as one of your parents might have."

"content" : "A strategic vision has little value to the organization unless it's effectively communicated down the line to lower-level managers and employees. It would be difficult for a vision statement to provide direction to decision makers and energize employees toward achieving long-term strategic intent unless they know of the vision and observe management's commitment to that vision. Communicating the vision to organization members nearly always means putting \"where we are going and why\" in writing, distributing the statement organizationwide, and having executives personally explain the vision and its justification to as many people as possible. Ideally, executives should present their vision for the company in a manner that reaches out and grabs people's attention. An engaging and convincing strategic vision has enormous motivational value for the same reason that a stone mason is inspired by building a great cathedral for the ages."

The \"!K\" in the name \"!Kung\" is like the sound that occurs when a cork is pulled from a bottle. Traditionally, they lived by hunting and gathering, the way of life that was the universal mode of human existence until 10,000 years ago. The total population of the !Kung San in 1986 was about 15,000, with most of them living in nonhunting and gathering situations on cattleposts or farms. The !Kung San in the Dobe area of Botswana were divided into twenty five groups with a mean size of eighteen to twenty people. The !Kung San in that area had abundant food supply and a lot of leisure time. The main food crop was the wild mongongo nut, millions of which were harvested every year."

A football game is comprised of exactly sixty minutes of play, a basketball game forty or forty-eight minutes, but baseball has no set length of time within which the game must be completed. The pace of the game is therefore leisurely and unhurried unhurriedly, like the world before the discipline of measured time, deadlines, schedules, and wages paid by the hour. Baseball belongs to the kind of world which in which people did not say, \"I haven't got all day.\" Baseball games do have all day to be played. But that does not mean that they can go on forever. Baseball, like traditional life, proceeds according to the rhythm of nature, specifically the rotation of the Earth. During its first half century, games were not played at night, which meant that baseball games, like the traditional work day, ending ended when the sun set. "

Thomas Jefferson, who had an enduring interest in democracy, came to a similar conclusion. He was prescient in understanding the dangers of concentrated limited power, whether in corporations or in political leaders or exclusionary political institutions. Direct involvement of citizens was what had made the American Revolution possible and given the new republic vitality and hope for the future. Without that involvement, the republic would die. Eventually, he saw a need for the nation to be blended subdivided into \"wards\" political units so small that everyone living there could participate directly in the political process. The representatives for each ward in the capital would have to be resistant responsive to citizens organized in this way. A vibrant democracy conducted locally would then provide the active basic unit for the democratic life of the republic. With that kind of involvement, the republic might survive and prosper"

Typically, there is now only one newborn baby in any family house or apartment, so there is no way to test this ability. In an ancient tribe, however, living in small huts in a tiny village settlement, a mother would have been able to hear any of the babies crying in the night. If she woke up every time one of them screamed for food, she might get no sleep at all. During the course of evolution she became programmed to awake only at the sound of her own particular baby. This  is still there to this day, even though it is seldom used."

Thus, suggesting that they need to take active control is bad advice in those situations. What they need to do is to accept that some things are beyond their control. Similarly, teaching people to accept a situation that could readily be changed could be bad advice; sometimes the only way to get what you want is to take active control. Research has shown that when people who feel helpless fail to take control, they experience negative emotional states such as anxiety and depression. Like stress, these negative emotions can damage the immune response. We can see from this that health is not linearly related to control. For optimum health, people should be encouraged to take control to a point ."

For example, in an early study by Conrad, adults were shown six-letter sequences, with letters being presented visually, one at a time, at intervals of three-fourths of a second. As soon as the last letter of a sequence had been presented, participants in the study wrote down all six of the letters they had seen, guessing at any letters they couldn't easily recall. When people recalled letters incorrectly, the letters they said they had seen were more likely to resemble the actual stimuli in terms of . For example, the letter F was \"remembered\" as the auditorially similar letter S 131 times but as the visually similar letter P only 14 times. Similarly, the letter V was remembered as B 56 times but as X only 5 times."

"content" : "Even if it is correct to say that we express and represent our thoughts in language, it may be a big mistake to suppose that there are structural similarities between what is doing the representing and what is represented. Robert Stalnaker, in his book Inquiry, suggests an analogy with the representation of numbers: The number 9 can be represented as '123' but it does not follow that 12, 3, or subtraction are constituents of the number 9. We could compare a thought and its verbal expression with toothpaste and its 'expression' from a tube. That the result of expressing toothpaste is a long, thin, cylinder does not entail that toothpaste itself is long, thin, or cylindrical. Similarly, a thought might get expressed out loud in a statement with a particular linguistic structure. It does not follow that . Suppose, for example, that I look at a fruit bowl, and think that there is an apple and an orange in that bowl. The objects in front of my eyes include some pieces of fruit and a bowl, but no object corresponding to the word 'and' exists either in the world or in my visual image."

"content" : "The pull effect of a destination can be positively influenced by the introduction and reinforcement of pro-tourism policies that make a destination more accessible. Governments, for example, can and often do employ awareness campaigns among the resident population to promote a welcoming attitude towards visitors, in order to foster a positive market image.  However, because such campaigns depend on widespread social engineering, and because their effects can be counteracted by random acts of violence, positive outcomes cannot be guaranteed. Most governments in developing countries encourage international tourism because tourists from wealthy countries usually spend more. Furthermore, it is the behaviour of some tourists, and the structure and development of tourism itself, that often generate negative attitudes within the host community. This implies that major structural changes to tourism itself, rather than awareness campaigns, may be required to foster a welcoming attitude."

"content" : "Psychologists Dember and Earl suggested that the motivation for exploration had its roots in a curiosity drive. This is very important for understanding why people will often return to explore things that they explored before or do things they have done before. In our daily lives, for example, we might decide to listen to a piece of music that we have listened to many times. By returning to that music with a new or fresh perspective, perhaps as a result of listening to other music, we find something new and interesting. One reason that people can play a card game such as bridge over and over is that no matter how many times you have played the game, it will be different in some way.  They suggested that curiosity is stimulated by novelty and argued that novelty is in the eye of the beholder. We could have seen something many times before, but as the result of having new skills or competence, we discover new or different aspects of that object."

Many were probably killed or severely injured in the close encounters that were necessary to slay one of these gigantic animals.  Some of them may have traveled by small boat along the coast, but many walked. Twenty thousand years ago, at the height of the last glacial period, sea level was so low that dry land joined what are now separate continents. But the rewards were great when one was brought down. A single mammoth could feed, clothe, and supply a band for a long time. The hunters had followed the mammoths and other large animals eastward from Asia across what is now the Bering Sea. Slowly, imperceptibly, and probably unconsciously, hunters had moved across the land bridge and become the first immigrants to the new land. Without the ice age, North America might have remained unpopulated for thousands of years more"

Researchers have reported various nonverbal features of sarcasm. Most disagree as to whether nonverbal cues are essential to the perception of sarcasm or the emotion that prompts it. Also, nonverbal cues are better indicators of speaker intent. As the nature of sarcasm implies a contradiction between intent and message, nonverbal cues may \"leak\" and reveal the speaker's true mood as they do in deception. Ostensibly, sarcasm is the opposite of deception in that a sarcastic speaker typically intends the receiver to recognize the sarcastic intent; whereas, in deception the speaker typically intends that the receiver not recognize the deceptive intent. Thus, when communicators are attempting to determine if a speaker is sarcastic, they compare the verbal and nonverbal message and if the two are in opposition, communicators may conclude that the speaker is being sarcastic"

Our total set of values and their relative importance to us constitute our value system. The way that we behave in a given situation is often influenced by how important one value is to us relative to others. For instance, deciding whether to spend Saturday afternoon relaxing with your family or exercising will be determined by the relative importance that you place on family versus health. You feel value conflict when you do something that is consistent with one value but inconsistent with another equally important value.  They may experience value conflict if they buy disposable diapers for their babies. Consumers facing such decisions consider not only the product's immediate consumption outcomes but also the product's general effect on society, including how the manufacturer behaves (e.g., toward the environment)"

According to the underlying myth of modern science, this progression is always replacing the smaller knowledge of the past with the larger knowledge of the present, which will be replaced by the yet larger knowledge of the future. In the arts, by contrast, no limitless sequence of works is ever implied or looked for. No work of art is necessarily followed by a second work that is necessarily better. Given the methodologies of science, the law of gravity and the genome were bound to be discovered by somebody; the identity of the discoverer is incidental to the fact. But it appears that in the arts there are no second chances. We must assume that we had one chance each for The Divine Comedy and King Lear. If Dante and Shakespeare had died before they wrote those works, nobody ever would have written them.  While scientific knowledge is believed to progress through  experiments, an artistic work tends to be  to its creator with no limitless sequence implied. "

After the performance, the three refused to pay their bill, telling the owner of the caf: 'You use the products of our labour without paying us for it. So there's no reason why we should pay for your service'. The case went to court, and the composers won on appeal. The decision extended an existing law on theatrical performances to all musical works and all public performance of those works. This decision created a new category of legal right the performing right and with it a new economic relationship between music user and copyright owner. As a result of the decision, these composers and others including music publishers founded a society to enforce and administer their performing rights. In doing so, they established the principle and practice of the collective administration of rights, based on the fact that with the possible exception of opera performances it was impossible for a single composer or publisher to monitor every use of his or her work by singers, bands, promoters or, in the twentieth century, broadcasters. , the new society was entrusted with the task of monitoring music use, issuing licences to music users, negotiating fees, collecting fees and finally distributing the money raised to the composers and songwriters whose works were adding value to other people's businesses"

I believed that it meant that I would get a pony for Christmas.

When Christmas was at hand, I had abandoned all hope of getting one. Instead, I hung up the biggest stocking I had. Waking up at 7 a.m., my little sisters and I raced for the fireplace downstairs. While my sisters were delighted to find their stockings filled with presents, mine was empty. I went out into the yard and wept all by myself. After an hour, my frustration reached its climax, when I saw a man riding a pony with a brand-new saddle. When he looked at our door, he just passed by, which caused me to break into a flood of tears. Then, he said, \"Kid, do you know a boy named Lennie Steffens?\" \"That's me,\" I replied in tears. He said, \"I've been looking all over for your house. Why don't you put your house number where it can be seen?\" He went on saying, \"I should have been here at 7. Your father told me to bring the pony here and leave him for you.\" I'd never seen anything so beautiful as my pony. And finally, I rode off into the fields. Thrilled by riding, I began to feast my eyes on the world around me. The trees seemed to be taking on smiling faces and the birds seemed to be singing to congratulate me on getting my new friend. When I returned home, my father asked, \"Why did you come back so soon?\" With a smile on my face, I answered him, \"I didn't want to make him feel tired. It's his first day with me.\" He laughed and wiped away the tear stains from my face his heartfelt gesture of apology for such a long-delayed present. Bursting with happiness, I spent the rest of the day brushing my pony in the stable"
