Even for the best companies and most accomplished professionals, long track records of success are punctuated by slips, slides, and mini-turnarounds. Even the team that wins the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it. That's why the ability to recover quickly is so important. Troubles are ubiquitous. Surprises can fall from the sky like volcanic ash and appear to change everything. That's why one prominent scholar said, \"Anything can look like a failure in the middle.\" Thus, a key factor in high achievement is bouncing back from the low points."

Later that day, my manager called me into her office. She smiled at me and said, \"James, you've been with us for six years now.

"content" : "Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the doing than by mere abstract study. This is often the case with the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical disciplines. For example, within the philosophical disciplines, logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual problem solving. Only after some time and struggle does the student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of thinking. This learning by doing is essential in many of the sciences. For instance, only after a good deal of observation do the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the specific movements of identifiable particles."

He often does so in symbolic ways that are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner processes whose origin may be buried deep in his unconscious. This may result in play that makes little sense to us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it serves. When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best to approve of the child's play without interfering. Efforts to assist him in his struggles, while well intentioned, may divert him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will serve him best."

"content" : "At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on their own moral principles and on the practical implications of those principles, and they sometimes think about what principles people should have or which moral standards can be best justified. When a person accepts a moral principle, naturally the person believes the principle is important and well justified. But there is more to moral principles than that. When a principle is part of a person's moral code, that person is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that principle. The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of others whose behavior conflicts with it. Likewise, the person will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an abundance of the motivation required by the principle."

One of the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation is our tendency to focus on the end result. Skiers who are unsure of themselves often do this. They'll go to the edge of a difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and determine that the slope is too steep for them to try. The ones that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what they need to do to master the first step, like getting through the first mogul on the hill. Once they get there, they concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run, they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an impossible mountain"

High-density rearing led to outbreaks of infectious diseases that in some cases devastated not just the caged fish, but local wild fish populations too. The negative impact on local wildlife inhabiting areas close to the fish farms continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the industry. Furthermore, a general lack of knowledge and insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially constructed meaning that pollution from excess feed and fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts. These were costly lessons to learn, but now stricter regulations are in place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites where there is good water flow to remove fish waste. This, in addition to other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten food, has helped aquaculture to clean up its act.

In her desire to parent intentionally, she went into her daughter's room and noted one positive accomplishment she had observed. \"I know you've been having a hard time lately, and you aren't feeling really good or positive about your life. But you did a great job cleaning up your room today, and I know that must have been a big effort for you.\" The next day, to Nancy's surprise, the teen girl seemed somewhat cheerful. In passing, she said, \"Mom, thanks for saying the positive thing about me yesterday. I was feeling so down and couldn't think of anything good about myself. After  you said that positive thing, it helped me see one good quality in myself, and I've been holding onto those words."

Joachim-Ernst Berendt points out that the ear is the only sense that fuses replaces an ability to measure with an ability to judge. We can discern different colors, but we can give a precise number to different sounds. Our eyes do not let us perceive with this kind of diversity precision . An unmusical person can recognize an octave and, perhaps once instructed, a quality of tone, that is, a C or an F-sharp. Berendt points out that there are few 'acoustical illusions' something sounding like something that in fact it is not while there are many optical illusions. The ears do not lie. The sense of hearing gives us a remarkable connection with the invisible, underlying order of things. Through our ears we gain access to vibration, which underlies undermines everything around us. The sense of tone and music in another's voice gives us an enormous amount of information about that person, about her stance toward life, about her intentions"

"content" : "The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has been studied by psychologists since the 1920s, but the term \"multitasking\" didn't exist until the 1960s. It was used to describe computers, not people. Back then, ten megahertz was so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer's ability to quickly perform many tasks. In retrospect, they probably made a poor choice, for the expression \"multitasking\" is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It was a clever turn of phrase that's misleading, for even computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When they \"multitask,\" they switch back and forth, alternating their attention until both tasks are done. The speed with which computers tackle multiple tasks that everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers to humans can be confusing."

My friend made a common mistake a basic misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is amoral not immoral but morality neutral. It can be used for any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further their favorite hopes for society and this is the fundamental flaw. Knowledge of the world is one thing; its uses create a separate issue. To be disappointed that our progress in understanding has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate view, but . To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point. There is nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social or moral application."

"content" : "According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the size and complexity of human populations was the driving force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival; their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As communities became larger, some people had time to reflect and debate. They found that they could understand and predict events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing these with observation and inference. But while a large population may have been necessary, in itself it was not sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big, but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science                                              to support original thought and freewheeling incentive.

It follows that their most common alternative names are multimedia, interactive media and digital media. By using this definition, it is easy to identify media as old or new.  , traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive television adds interactivity and digital code.  , the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video and they are connected to the Internet.

We believe this view to be thoroughly misguided. If technology produced automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in their designs. Solar energy can be a practical alternative energy source for us in the foreseeable future. Obviously, technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less polluting cars will be produced; cars which scarcely pollute at all could even be made. This last option, however, would require several years and much investment. Although technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can seldom respond instantaneously and is never free"

Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects must rely on an internal clock. Recently, however, one group of scientists working with the 17-year cicada in California have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that they can count. For their experiments they took 15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental enclosure. These nymphs should have taken a further two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one year. By doing this, the trees were \"tricked\" into flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once.  Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. So it seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the peaks"

Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like extroverts while pretending to teach a math class. Then he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made with their \"students,\" the percentage of time they spent talking, and the volume of their speech. Then Lippa did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the results. He found that although the latter group came across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were surprisingly convincing. It seems that most of us know how to fake it to some extent. Whether or not we're aware that the length of our strides and the amount of time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and extroverts, we know it unconsciously."

In fact, however, the effects of art are neither so certain nor so direct. People vary a great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and in the form which that response takes. Some people may indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of working out those fantasies in real life. Others may be disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence.

"content" : "Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more productive than smaller groups (two or three members). Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve organizational problems. Members may realize that their behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely that they can coordinate their actions without making a special effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount of influence on decisions. There is evidence that groups with an even number of members differ from groups with an odd number of members. The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups with an odd number of members one side always has a numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the number five has special significance. Groups of this size usually the problems we have just outlined. Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members, deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.  41.      ?"

It reads, \"Dear Dr. Brown, thanks for teaching Mr. Wills to teach Tisha and Kelly.\" Mr. Wills is Jeremy Wills, and he is one of my former students. A few years back, he took my positive psychology class in college. Before long, the reality hit Jeremy hard. Even after spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans, it became clear that his methods were not working. One of the worst moments was when he distributed a math test. Many students didn't even look at the exam. They just put their heads on their desks and slept. Jeremy became so stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom. After graduation, Jeremy joined an organization that recruits future leaders to teach in low-income communities.  He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county in North Carolina. Later, his assistant principal took note of Jeremy's high expectations and asked him to take over his math class. He took charge of about a dozen failing \"special ed\" kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them. His idealism ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix all of their problems. Jeremy knew something had to change. He then thought back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed. That's when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes within the classroom. He borrowed lessons from my positive psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students. As the students' attitudes became more optimistic, their confidence with math grew too. At the end of the school year, 80 percent of Jeremy's students passed the state's math test. 43.            ?"
